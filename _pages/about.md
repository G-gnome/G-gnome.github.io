I completed my BS in Biology in 2022 at Fort Lewis College in  Durango Colorado. There, I worked on many projects spanning synthetic organic chemistry, ecology, and molecular virology. I participated in the National Science Foundation REU program in the summer of 2021 where I participated in the structural studies of membrane proteins using cryo-electron microscopy. I joined the [Jason Stajich lab](https://lab.stajich.org/members/kian-kelly.html) at University of California Riverside as a Plant Pathology PhD student in 2023.

My current research spans several distinct areas. Firstly, I have focused on the ecology of biological soil crust fungi. My work has highlighted that biocrust-fungal associations are an ideal model to characterize the interactions between ancient organisms such as moss and fungi. It has also illuminated the role of aridity on biocrust fungi, and shed light on the effects of climate change on dryland microbial diversity. 

Through a culture dependent survey, my NSF REU mentee and I obtained many extreme adapted fungi which were hitherto unknown to science and sequenced their genomes. This will lead to a deeper understanding of the genomic adaptations which mediate life at the extremes. Finally, I am attempting to use machine learning to determine the genomic coordinates of fungal MAT loci. 

I am an avid lover of nature and spend most of my time outside of the lab hiking, hanging out with my dog, and helping with the family camping business. 

I am not exactly sure what I want to do after my PhD, but I am excited about the possibities. If I sound like a good fit for your organization, please email me using the link below. Cheers!
