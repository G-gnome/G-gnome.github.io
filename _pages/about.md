Kian joined the [Jason Stajich lab](https://lab.stajich.org/members/kian-kelly.html) at University of California Riverside as a Plant Pathology PhD student in 2023 after completing his BS from Fort Lewis College. His research surveys the mycobiome of biological soil crusts, charactarizes the genomic features of extreme adapted fungi, and deciphers the cryptic relationships between ancient plants and fungi. He is an avid lover of nature and spends most of his time outside of the lab hiking, reading Jack London, and daydreaming about mycology.
