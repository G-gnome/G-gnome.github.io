One of my projects is to investigate the genomic features that enable polyextremophilic yeasts such as Exophiala, Naganishia, and Rhodotorula to survive in environments including the Japan Trench at 6000m below sea level, Antarctica, NASA clean rooms and the Mojave Desert.

We are wroking on sequencing the genomes of our Naganishia isolates from the Mojave Desert along with other extreme environments for a quantitative genetics project.

This project will lead to a deeper understanding of the genetic adaptations that mediate adaptations to extreme environments.
