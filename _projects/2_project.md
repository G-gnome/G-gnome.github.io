Mosses are bryophytes: some of the most ancient terrestrial plants and amoung the first to colonize land. They are very hardy, and can survive in extreme environments including the Mojave Desert and Antarctica. The microbes that facilitate their survival in extreme environments are unknown. Understanding these associations may reveal ancient symbioses which mediated the terrestrialization of aquatic plants and the terraforming processes which eventually permited human life.

We are using a metabarcoding approach to catalogue the fungi associated with mosses in the Mojave Desert to better understand their fungal symbionts.

We are also planning to assay the interactions between these fungi under conditions of stress to characterize their potential roles in facilitating their persistance at the extremes. This researh will result in a deeper understanding of the evolution of early life on the planet.
