2023 was a big year for me. I joined a lab as a PhD student, served as an NSF REU mentor, presented at my first conference, and made significant progress in my studies.

I had many great experiences during my first year, including visiting the Mojave and Colorado Deserts to collect moss. I also went to Arizona for the Mycological Society of America Conference to present some of my early work.

My NSF REU undergraduate and I were able to culture some interesting microbes associated with the moss. This will lead to publications in the near future. I was very proud of how well he did.

Overall, 2023 was a great year in many ways but I don't think I'll miss it!
