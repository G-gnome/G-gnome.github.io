      year: 2022-2025
      description:
        - Generated genomic and metagenomic nanopore and illumina sequence data, resulting in 8 novel fungal genomes and 10,000 taxa identified through metagenomic analysis
        - Performed comparative genomic analysis of extremophilic fungi resulting in the identification of potentially horizontally acquired genes conferring extreme resistance phenotypes.
        - Analyzed NGS data using R, and Python, utilizing custom built pipelines resulting in three publications (in preparation)
        - Mentoring undergraduate students by teaching fungal culturing techniques and bioinformatics methods, including data analysis using custom pipelines.
        - Lead developer for sequence classification software using machine learning (Python). 
        - Expertise in fungal culturing, DNA extraction, PCR, Illumina library preparation, and nanopore sequencing techniques.
        - Obtained first cultures of 15+ undescribed fungal species. Developed strain library of 100+ extreme adapted microbes for bioprospecting use in the National Science Foundation ExFAB Biofoundry.
